            are ultimately in the back-end as well.Current goal is to become a

            had a great experience and thoroughly learned and enjoyed my
            internship. My interest in front-end was rooted from this
            internship. And I will also try to do more of these internships.
          </p>
          <h2>Bootcamps</h2>
          <p class="moreabout1">

            bootcamp I learned the basics of Python. And right now I'm attending
            a full stack development bootcamp. This bootcamp strengthened my
